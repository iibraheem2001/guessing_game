        <h2 class="heading">Short Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Barnum, however I go by Jon. I grew up in an Air Force family so I moved around every 2-4 years. My father retired in Utah and I have been here for many years so I call Utah home. I met my wife while attending Utah Valley University. I’ve been married for 14 years and have 4 kids. I joined the military in 2008 and decided to be a military police in the Army. I thought I would do that for a couple of years and get out and go on to bigger and better things. I realized law enforcement was not for me and went on to become an ER nurse. I think working too many nights, weekends and holidays took a toll on me and decided to switch careers into web development. This is where I am at today and couldn’t be happier.</p>
